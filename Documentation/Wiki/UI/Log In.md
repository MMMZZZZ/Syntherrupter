## What you get

### Authentification

By typing a password that matches one of the three user passwords, you'll log in with the rights of that user. You have an infinite number of attemps but a delay between each attempt. This isn't meant as a high security thing, rather to prevent "oopsies" from less experienced users you might grant access to your coil (see [User Settings](Users.md#readme) for details about the different roles). 

As you can see, the log in page only allows numbers to be entered. Thus you shouldn't set the password to anything else than a number or you won't be able to log in. 

### Auto log in and Default Passwords

This is detailed on the [User Settings](Users.md#passwords) wiki page.
