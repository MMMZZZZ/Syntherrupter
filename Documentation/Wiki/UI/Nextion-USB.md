# Nextion<->USB Passthrough

[Back to the User Interface Reference page](README.md#readme)

This mode connects the Nextion RX/TX pins to the onboard USB-serial converter. Because this is done through software the baudrate is limited to "only" 512000 baud/s. Not much else to say except for what's written on the screen.

You may want to check the [Firmware Flashing](/Documentation/Wiki/Firmware%20Flashing.md#readme) article for more details about flashing new firmwares using this mode.
