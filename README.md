# Syntherrupter
Powerful polyphonic MIDI Interrupter with GUI for Tesla Coils based on the TI Tiva TM4C1294XL microcontroller board and a Nextion resistive Touch Display.
You can control up to 6 different coils simultaneously. On each coil you can play up to 6 notes - making a total of 36 voices. Should be enough for most MIDI files ;) 

# Download and Installation
Have a look at the [releases page](https://github.com/MMMZZZZ/Syntherrupter/releases).

# Documentation
Source code is not overwhelmingly documented but there's a complete documentation of all features, how to use it and how to build your own. Its pretty simple and cheap.
